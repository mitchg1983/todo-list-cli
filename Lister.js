//I decided to use one array to store most of the data for my list. I wasn't sure how much I wanted to "do" with the data;
//for example, I may want to be able to priorititze certain items, or categorize them. I ended up using five 'slots' for
//each item on my list. So the first item, Bacon, then has four free 'slots' next to it.
//
//This first function is written to test the functionality of my system. It will return to the user only certain items in
//out array. If I enter 'test' as the value for an element, in the next index after an item, this function will ignore it and
//move on to the next item.
//
//This might be some useless code currently, as I decided to instead move items out of this array completely.
//
//Using functions from the beginning, made it much easier later on to switch over to using multiple arrays.

//index 2 is the timestamp, etc...
